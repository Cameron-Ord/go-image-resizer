## **A simple script for batch processing JPG images into 4 different sizes**

### Download:
Either clone the repo or download the zip

### To run:
**chmod +x build.sh**
**./build.sh**
**./run.sh**


The program reads JPG images from a folder titled /to_process/. The run script will create both processed and to_process directories, however, images obviously need to be present in /to_process/ to actually be processed.
